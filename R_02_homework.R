#R - Homework 02

# Using the SQLite database contained in the 'homework.db' file, calculate the MEDIAN number
# of arrivals and departures at Los Angeles Airport for each of the 12 months of the year.
# Then save the result to a CSV file.
#
# Note that for each month you have information about several types of flights:
# you need to pre-sum them.

# Change Month column format:
month.name[(flights$Month)] # Creates vector that translates number into full month name
# month.abb[(flights$Month)] # that would create 'Jan' instead of 'January'

# Assign vector to dataset, replacing numbers with month names
flights$Month <- month.name[(flights$Month)]  

# Create .csv file with final data (w/o row index):
